A basic react project for learning the basics of client side react

## Tutorials used
https://www.codementor.io/tamizhvendan/beginner-guide-setup-reactjs-environment-npm-babel-6-webpack-du107r9zr
Followed this tutorial to set up the client side react.

https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html
This from the react docs was used to add the time to the application

## Set up instructions
1) Run `npm install` to install the required node modules.
2) Run `npm run build` to compile the jsx into browser compatible js.
3) In a browser open
`file://PATH_TO_REPO/react-hello-world/public/index.html` and the page should
open.

## Future plans
* Develop a basic PHP backend that returns some generated data in some restful
format, and use that data to populate react elements using JS fetch.
